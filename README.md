OnlinePortfolio

## Overview

This is my online portfolio, used to advertise my skills and experience to potential employers.  It utilises Google Web Starter Kit as a starting point.  [Web Starter Kit](http://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit) is an opinionated boilerplate for web development.

## Browser Support

At present, this application is aimed to support the following browsers:

* IE9, IE10, IE11, IE Mobile 10
* FF 30, 31
* Chrome 34, 35
* Safari 7, 8
* Opera 23, 24
* iOS Safari 7, 8
* Opera Coast
* Android / Chrome 4.4, 4.4.3
* BlackBerry 10

This is not to say it cannot be used in browsers older than those reflected, but merely that our focus will be on ensuring our layouts work great in the above.
